/// @file
/// @brief Task1: "single-file" executable C program

/// @todo Include C standard library headers as needed

/// @todo Implement a function 'isprime' according to the description below:
/// - the function receives an 'unsigned int' value and
/// - returns 'true' (or 1) if the value is a prime number
/// - returns 'false' (or 0) if the value is a not a prime number
/// @note you need to include '#include <stdbool.h>' to be able to use a boolean type 'bool'
///       and constants 'true' and 'false'

/// @todo Implement a function 'count_primes' according to the description below:
/// - the function receives an array of 'unsigned int' values, e.g. 'unsigned int values[]', and also its size as a
/// separate parameter
/// - the function returns the number of prime numbers in the array
/// @note use your function 'isprime' to check for primes in the array

/// @todo Implement a 'main' function conducting the following tasks in this order:
/// - construct two local arrays of type 'unsigned int[]' containing the following sequences of values:
///   {1, 20, 21, 43, 32, 42, 2344, 42433, 6, 2, 0, 22, 45, 47, 1033, 1247}
///   {21, 22, 44, 33, 7, 3, 1, 23, 46, 48, 1034, 1248}
/// - use your function 'count_primes' to count the number of primes in each of the sequences
/// - print the overall number of primes (summing both results) to the console

int main() { return 0; }
